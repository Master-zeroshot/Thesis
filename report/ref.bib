abstract = {We study the problem of object recognition for categories for which we have no training examples, a task also called zero-data or zero-shot learning. This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them. To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape. Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task. Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000 images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes. Extensive experiments on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {Most machine-learning methods focus on classifying instances whose classes have already been seen in training. In practice, many applications require classifying instances whose classes have not been seen previously. Zero-shot learning is a powerful and promising learning paradigm, in which the classes covered by training instances and the classes we aim to classify are disjoint. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of zero-shot learning. First of all, we provide an overview of zero-shot learning. According to the data utilized in model optimization, we classify zero-shot learning into three learning settings. Second, we describe different semantic spaces adopted in existing zero-shot learning works. Third, we categorize existing zero-shot learning methods and introduce representative methods under each category. Fourth, we discuss different applications of zero-shot learning. Finally, we highlight promising future research directions of zero-shot learning.},

@TechReport{Koch,
abstract = {The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very compu-tationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototyp-ical example of this is the one-shot learning setting , in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity between inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discrimina-tive features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art performance on one-shot classification tasks. Humans exhibit a strong ability to acquire and recognize new patterns. In particular, we observe that when presented with stimuli, people seem to be able to understand new concepts quickly and then recognize variations on these concepts in future percepts (Lake et al., 2011). Machine learning has been successfully used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of applications such as web search, spam detection, caption generation, and speech and image recognition. However, these algorithms often break down when forced to make predictions about data for which little supervised information is available. We desire to generalize to these unfamiliar categories without necessitating extensive retraining which may be either expensive or impossible due to limited data or in an online prediction setting, such as web retrieval.},
